        <li>½ cup (40 grams) parmesan grated</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, boil water and salt it. Add your pasta, and cook according to the package instructions until
        al dente. When the pasta is cooked, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>In a skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter, and add olive oil. Cook the shrimp for a minute, then
        season with salt, pepper, and Old Bay Seasoning or paprika if using.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook the shrimp until it’s pink. Do this in batches if you’re worried that you may overcook the shrimp.
        Remove the shrimp onto a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, melt the remaining butter and add garlic, cook for 30 seconds or until it's fragrant. Add the heavy
        cream, and with the spatula deglaze the pan.</li>
        <li>Add parmesan, let it melt then loosen the sauce with reserved pasta water and allow to simmer for a minute. Taste the
        sauce and see if more salt and pepper is needed.</li>
        <li>Toss the pasta with the sauce until it’s well coated. Add the shrimp back in to reheat it gently, garnish with freshly
        chopped parsley and serve.</li>
