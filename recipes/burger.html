    <h2>This is by far one of the best homemade hamburger recipes I have ever had. It has the perfect amount of seasonings and
    is super juicy.</h2>
    <p>
    What are the ingredients of a classic burger? Well, you of course need your meat (protein), then an egg to hold it all
    together, some type of bread crumb flavor and fullness, milk to incorporate the breading, and then your favorite
    seasonings for the hamburger ingredients.

    <h3>Patty</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef (I used 85/15 beef)</li>
        <li>1 egg beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>dash of cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Mayo</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Grilled Pineapple</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Sautéed peppers and onions</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Onion ring</li>
        <li>Olives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add all ingredients. Mix together using your hands until ingredients are barely combined (be
        sure to not overmix because then the hamburgers will become dense).</li>
        <li>Form the mixture into 8 patties. Be sure to make them a little larger than the patties that you plan to use because
        ground beef shrinks when it cooks.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil the grill grate and place patties on top of grill.</li>
        <li>Grill patties until no longer pink on the inside or until they reach desired doneness (I usually grill mine for about 5
        minutes on each side).</li>
        <li>Place cooked burger on a hamburger bun and top with favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
