        <h1>Sicilian-Style Pizza</h1>
        <img src="/odin-recipes/images/sicilian-style-pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza King Arthurs">
        <h2>Although Sicilian pizza is often used to refer to a pie with a thick, rectangular, sheet pan-sized crust, there can be a
        little more to it than just its shape and size.</h2>
        <p>
        In Sicily, a generous, almost focaccia-like crust is commonly topped
        with an abundance of strong cheese and sauce (in that order), along with onions, anchovies, and herbs. Our version here
        is a riff on these Sicilian toppings, layered onto a golden, crispy bottomed, soft and chewy crust.

        <h3>Pizza Dough</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 1/2 cups (540g) High-Gluten Flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons (12g) salt</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups (397g) lukewarm water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pizza Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon (14g) olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (227g) sweet yellow onion, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup (227g) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 anchovies, finely chopped; optional</li>
            <li>3 cups (340g) grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>To make the dough:</strong>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Mix and knead together
            all of the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — using just enough water to make a very soft, smooth
            dough; you may not need all of the water.</li>
            <li>Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 hour. Use immediately; or refrigerate for up to 24 hours to develop the crust's
            flavor.</li>
            <li>Use olive oil to lightly coat the bottom and edges of a half-sheet pan (18" x 13").</li>
            <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator, transfer it to the pan, and use your hands to gradually stretch it out towards
            the edges. When the dough starts to shrink back, let it relax, uncovered, for about 10 to 15 minutes, then stretch it
            again. You'll want the dough to fill the pan, so repeat the relax-stretch process two or three times until it does.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rise for 1 to 2 hours, until it's noticeably puffy. The longer it's been refrigerated, the longer it's
            likely to take to rise.</li>
            <li><strong>To make the topping:</strong>Pour the olive oil into a large sauté pan set over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>When the oil is hot, add the onions and cook them until they're soft and lightly golden, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the onions to a large bowl, add the tomato sauce, and stir until evenly combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Towards the end of the dough's rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F.</li>
            <li>Bake the untopped pizza crust for 10 to 12 minutes, until it's barely beginning to brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, and top it with the anchovies, cheese, and tomato-onion sauce</li>
            <li>Return the pizza to the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes, until the edges are golden brown and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, sprinkle the pizza with Pizza Seasoning and fresh herbs, and drizzle with dipping oil.</li>
